# Self-Labeling Video Prediction  
  
Code for paper "Self-Labeling Video prediction".  

In this project, we provide the code of our paper "Self-Labeling Video prediction" which is submitted to journal for possible publication.  

In this paper, we propose a novel self-labeling framework that can easily equip with popular video prediction models and help resolve the multi-modal entanglement over the latent variables.
